Program 5
The goal of this part is to use the created abstract syntax 
tree to create a low level language. Whick for this is called
oil (the intermediate language). 

How to RUN:
make sure all of the files are in the same folder
type "gmake all"
now oc is created

./oc -y -l [-@ flags] [-D string] program.oc

-l calls the flex debug 
-y calls the parse debug

the only debug flag right now is
-@f, a, x, and m



-D is use to supress code.
