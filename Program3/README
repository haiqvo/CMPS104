Program 3
The goal of this part of the program is to make a parser using bison. 
We have to make a parser.y file that correctly parses the file. 
The parse are directed to the .ast file.

How to RUN:
make sure all of the files are in the same folder
type "gmake all"
now oc is created

./oc -y -l [-@ flags] [-D string] program.oc

-l calls the flex debug 
-y calls the parse debug

the only debug flag right now is
-@f, a, x, and m



-D is use to supress code.
